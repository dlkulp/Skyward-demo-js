                <br /><strong>Sneaky Snake:</strong><br />
                A procedurally generated game first written for the CodeDay:Portland in February of 2015 at Prolifiq using the custom-made Argyle Engine.  The game is by no means dead and I still work on it in my spare time!
                <br /><br /><strong>Objective:</strong><br />
                Sneak around the little guys to make your way to the teleporter to bring you to the next level.  If you don't see a teleporter make sure to check all the corners!  Walking over the little ones increases your score and speed but also makes you longer.  Plan carefully!
